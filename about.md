contact me at <rawxtl@outlook.com>, currently there is no mailng list. i will implement it soon, the next plan is to re-write the whole jekyll framework in [go](https://go.dev/). why? cuz i got worms in my balls and can't stop scratching. like i just made this site and already planning to rewrite the whole thing interms of systems. the main set back for me in jeklly is that the yml file is shit. or i think it is and want to swap it out for toml. i don't need any multi-block string. and also replace liquid with something similar or custom made. the whole idea is the same mardown file and a few html for layout -> build the markdown to html and serve staticlly

but with fewer folder in the root and one config file.
